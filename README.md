# 🚀 30 Days of NLP with Pavan Aditya Kumar Gorrela

Welcome to the **#30DaysOfNLP** journey!  
In this series, we explore the foundations and applications of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** — one day at a time — through code, concepts, projects, and blog posts.


## 📚 About This Series

🧠 Natural Language Processing is at the heart of intelligent applications like chatbots, search engines, translators, and virtual assistants.  
This repository is a **daily hands-on guide** to mastering key NLP topics, tools, and techniques using Python and popular libraries like NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn, Hugging Face Transformers, and more!

📜 I earned my NLP Certification via **Udemy**, and this series is a curated, extended, and applied version of that learning experience.
